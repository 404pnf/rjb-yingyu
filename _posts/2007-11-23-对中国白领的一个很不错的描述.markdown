title: ! '对中国白领的一个很不错的描述 '
---

<blockquote>
  <p>Somewhere in the middle of this spectrum are the individuals that I conduct day-to-day communication with, usually consisting of white collar Chinese employees in large multinational companies who have graduated from some of the top universities in China and speak a smattering of English and who, as a result, hold the mistaken belief that they are a superior class far above other Chinese. These are some of the most arrogant, self-important yet ironicallly ignorant and unprofessional individuals that I&#8217;ve ever had the misfortune to deal with.</p>
