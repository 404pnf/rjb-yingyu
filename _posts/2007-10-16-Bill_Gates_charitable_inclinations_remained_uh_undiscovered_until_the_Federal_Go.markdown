  <p>If you were a real cynic you might note that Bill&#8217;s charitable inclinations remained, uh, undiscovered until the Federal Government began to file anti-trust lawsuits. You would then see his charitable contributions as investments in the maintenance of Microsoft&#8217;s monopoly and not reductions in wealth.</p>
