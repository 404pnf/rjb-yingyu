title: willy nilly

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: We don&#8217;t have a contract with the hotel, we can&#8217;t just write them cheques willy-nilly! And we most certainly cannot act as a guarantee for all our clients.</p>
  
  <p>Harpy: They won&#8217;t bank it in, they just want a guarantee. It doesn&#8217;t need to say anything, you can just (I swear to God this is exactly what she said) write a blank cheque.</p>
  
  <p>Me: <em>sputtering</em> I&#8230; WHAT?</p>
  
  <p>Harpy: That&#8217;s right, you heard me.</p>
  
  <p>Me: Look Miss Harpy, I don&#8217;t think you understand the definition of a guarantor. In fact, there is no agreement, written or otherwise, that names our company asParty A&#8217;s guarantor.</p>
  
  <p>Harpy: <em>spitting fire</em> I don&#8217;t see what the big deal is.</p>
