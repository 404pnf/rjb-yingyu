  There are quite a few wealthy Chinese who have the spare funds available to blow on a social status SUV.

<p>I&#8217;ve been to moscow, you can avoid running into a landrover, running into might be a bad choice of word, but most of the &#8216;rover drivers are driving &#8220;not safely to the others&#8221;. I do get a pseudo feeling (?) of safe when in a hunky SUV. I feel safer when I run into/crash other cars.</p>

<p>Before shouting on me, let me get this out first, i don&#8217;t have a car, yet!</p>
