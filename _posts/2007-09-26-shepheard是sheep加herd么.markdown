---

<p>lonely shepherd 好听的曲子
刚发现shepherd这个词应该是 sheep 和 herd的组合 
sheep就是羊 herd 是一群羊的群
所以组合就是牧羊狗吧 ：） 一条狗看一群羊萨。
我这种猜测对么？</p>

<li><p>A shepherd is one who takes care of sheep, usually in flocks in the fields. Shepherding is one of the oldest professions, beginning some 10,000 years ago in Asia Minor. Sheep were kept for their milk, meat, and especially their wool. Over the next millennia sheep and shepherding spread throughout Eurasia.

<li><p>A herd is a large group of animals. The term is usually applied to mammals, particularly ungulates. Other terms are used for similar phenomena in other types of animal. For example, a large group of birds is usually called as flock and a large group of carnivores is usually called a pack. In addition, special terms may be used for particular taxa: for example a flock of geese is sometimes called a gaggle. &#8230;
