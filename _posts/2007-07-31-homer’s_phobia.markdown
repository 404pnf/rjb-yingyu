<p>i was reading on wikipedia and a link brought me to this article
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer%27s_Phobia">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer%27s_Phobi</a></p>

<p>I watched this episode and i remembered it, but i don&#8217;t konw it was an outstanding one (theme-wise and award-wise) and story hehind it (Fox tried to censor it).</p>

<p>Who would thought gay theme topic would be taboo in the US in <strong>1997</strong>. I think it&#8217;s still a very conservative enviornment in &#8220;over the air&#8221;</p>
