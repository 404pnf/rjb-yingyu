title: Remember when banks used to pay you for borrowing your money It’s true. They
  did. Ask your parents

<blockquote>
  <p>So Citibank, if you are reading this, please reckognize that the money you keep from my reach when you deny my card is in fact <em>MY</em> money and not yours. Citibank told me on the phone today that this is for <em>MY</em> protection when it is in fact for Citibanks protection because they are legally responsible to cover fraudulent charges to my account. So, Citibank basically denys whatever they feel like apparently- or whatever the computer algorithm decides to deny.</p>
  
  <p>Sorry to ramble. Bottom line: Citibank’s name is mud to me and if this trouble continues, I will take the issue more publicly through my audio and video programs and, of course, find another bank who will allow me access to my own money.</p>

<p>it&#8217;s called a debit card.</p>

<p>i don&#8217;t have credit card, and i don&#8217;t want one either. There had been a craze in solicitating/forcing people to have a credit card in the past one year!!!</p>
