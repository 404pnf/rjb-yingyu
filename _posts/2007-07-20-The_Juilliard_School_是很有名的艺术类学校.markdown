<p>The Juilliard School 是很有名的艺术类学校</p>

<p>Now I know how to spell this well-known school, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juilliard_School">The Juilliard School</a>. I thought it&#8217;s Julia.</p>

<p>In the movie, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malibu%27s_Most_Wanted">Malibu&#8217;s Most Wanted</a>, the two black actors (they play actors in the film) were hired to &#8220;play ghetto&#8221;, to play gansters, and when questioned about &#8220;if you think you can&#8217;t handle the job&#8221;, one replied:&#8221;oh, we can handle it. God, I graduated from Juillard&#8221;. It&#8217;s such a great take that blacks graduated from prestigious art school and still hired to play gangsters or something to that effect as one actor puts it. I love that movie!</p>
