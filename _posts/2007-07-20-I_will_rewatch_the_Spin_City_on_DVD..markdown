<p>I will rewatch the Spin City on DVD.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Spin City has not yet been released on DVD - or at least not entirely, but will be in the near future. Dreamworks has, however, published two smaller DVD boxes titled &#8220;Michael J. Fox - His All Time Favorites&#8221; Vols. 1 and 2 in 2003, both containing eleven episodes.

<p>Some episodes are pretty funny!</p>
