title: precedence pertinent
---

<p>precedence; pertinent</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yesterday I was translating an article by a People’s University professor that called for Chinese to take precedence over English during the Olympics.  More than half-way through the translation, I realised that the article is too long for a blog post and no one will read it.  Instead, I will summarise the article briefly because I think it mentions some pertinent points.  The article appeared on page 31 in the Nanfang Zhoumo on August 16.

<p>To summerize the article on the newspaper, the auther believes &#8220;Instead of concentrating on English, he believes that the Olympics present a great opportunity to popularise Chinese. &#8220;</p>
