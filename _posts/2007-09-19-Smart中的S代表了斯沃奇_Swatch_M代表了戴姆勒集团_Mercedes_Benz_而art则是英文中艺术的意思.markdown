  <p>Smart中的S代表了斯沃奇(Swatch)，M代表了戴姆勒集团(Mercedes-Benz)，而art则是英文中艺术的意思，合起来可以理解为，这部车代表了斯沃奇和戴姆勒合作的艺术，而Smart车名本身在英文中也有聪明伶俐的意思，这也契合了Smart公司的设计理念

<blockquote>
  <p>The original idea behind the very short &#8220;smart car&#8221; is that the vehicle is easy to park. It is short enough to allow it to be parked &#8220;nose-in&#8221; where a conventionally sized car would have to parallel park. Its length of 2.5 metres (98.4 in) equals the width of a truck or a regular parking slot, allowing two or three smarts to park in the same space as one normal car if parked side-on to the usual parking direction.

  <p>The project idea was originally supported by Swiss watch manufacturer Swatch, and was nicknamed the &#8220;Swatchmobile&#8221;. The name SMART is an acronym for Swatch Mercedes ART.[1][2] The car was supposed to use innovative features (such as a hybrid engine) and to be an affordable car for young people. Similar to the objective for the Citroën 2CV in the 1940s, its purpose was to &#8220;transport two people and a case of beer&#8221;.</p>
