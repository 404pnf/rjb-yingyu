title: “first time as tragedy second time as farce” farce在这里是是笑话的意思么 马克思的原话翻译成中文是什么

<blockquote>
  <p>When Karl Marx wrote that every great historical event occurs twice &#8212; &#8220;first time as tragedy, second time as farce&#8221; &#8212; I doubt he had print media in mind. And yet the upset of the paper industry feels to me like the joke that comes after the tragedy of print media&#8217;s fast decline. <a href="http://www.alternet.org/columnists/story/55162/">source</a></p>

<p>A farce is a comedy written for the stage, or a film, which aims to entertain the audience by means of unlikely and extravagant - yet often possible - situations, disguise and mistaken identity, verbal humour of varying degrees of sophistication, which may include puns and sexual innuendo, and a fast-paced plot whose speed usually increases even further towards the end of the play, often involving an elaborate chase scene. &#8230;

  <p>马克思有句很有名的话,它的大意是伟大的事物总是要出现两次,第一次以悲剧结束第二次以喜剧收场.
