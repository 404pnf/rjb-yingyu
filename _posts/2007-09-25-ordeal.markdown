*Trial by ordeal is a judicial practice by which the guilt or innocence of the accused is determined by subjecting them to a painful task. The determination of innocence coming from either completing the task uninjured or by the quick healing of the wounds taken. Like trial by combat, it was a judicium Dei: a procedure based on the premise that God would help the innocent.
