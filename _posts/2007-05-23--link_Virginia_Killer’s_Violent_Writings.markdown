<blockquote>
  <p>APRIL 17&#8211;The college student responsible for yesterday&#8217;s Virginia Tech slaughter was referred last year to counseling after professors became concerned about the violent nature of his writings, as evidenced in a one-act play obtained by The Smoking Gun. The play by Cho Seung-Hui, a 23-year-old English major, was submitted last year as part of a short story writing class. Entitled &#8220;Richard McBeef,&#8221; Cho&#8217;s bizarre play features a 13-year-old boy who accuses his stepfather of pedophilia and murdering his father. A copy of the killer&#8217;s play can be found below. The teenager talks of killing the older man and, at one point, the child&#8217;s mother brandishes a chain saw at the stepfather. The play ends with the man striking the child with &#8220;a deadly blow.&#8221; (10 pages)</p>
