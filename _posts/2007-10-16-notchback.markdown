<blockquote>
  <p>The car is essentially a notchback sedan version of the European C4 model, since the Chinese market prefers traditional three-box sedans over hatchbacks. It did not keep the designation, however, because in Chinese the number &#8220;4&#8243; is unlucky. The sedan is much larger than the hatchback: its length is 4770 mm over the hatchback&#8217;s 4260 mm and its wheelbase measures 2710 mm against 2610 mm of the hatchback. The C-Triomphe has a number of unique features, such as an integrated air freshener which allows the driver to choose the smell of the interior
