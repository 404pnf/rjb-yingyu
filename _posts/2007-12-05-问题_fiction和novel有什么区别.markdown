title: 问题 fiction和novel有什么区别
---

lvcha问：

>对了。novel fiction 有啥区别？

用googole搜索

[what’s the differnce between novel and fiction](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&newwindow=1&client=firefox-a&rls=com.ubuntu%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&hs=I7S&q=what%27s+the+difference+between+novel+and+fiction&btnG=Search)

这里主要是说novel和book的区别

我还不知道有novella这个词呢：

想看小说没有reading list么，这个可能有帮助 

I have located several lists of great books and novels:

但我更推荐直接去Project Gutenberg找。

现在继续回答问题。网上没有好答案。我们用wordnet来查查看。

fiction

The noun fiction has 2 senses (first 1 from tagged texts)

1. (14) fiction — (a literary work based on the imagination and not necessarily on fact)

2. fabrication, fiction, fable — (a deliberately false or improbable account)

ovel

The noun novel has 2 senses (first 1 from tagged texts)

*(17) novel — (an extended fictional work in prose; usually in the form of a story)

*novel — (a printed and bound book that is an extended work of fiction; “his bookcases were filled with nothing but novels”; “he burned all the novels”)The adj novel has 2 senses (first 1 from tagged texts)

*(6) fresh, new, novel — (original and of a kind not seen before; “the computer produced a completely novel proof of a well-known theorem”)

*novel, refreshing — (pleasantly new or different; “common sense of a most refreshing sort”)看novel第2个sense。说是extended work of ficiton。基本可以理解为在长度上有区别的。这里的extended是专指长度么？那么根据yahoo answer中有人的答案，看来字数可以成为一个不严格的分界线。6000字？还是应该多少字呢？

还有，

lvcha sez:

>fiction是小说，包括各种杂七杂八的yellow，violence。。monster。。？

  novel是长篇小说或者严肃点算是文学的小说？

ovel也可以杂七杂八

感觉这两个基本通用 

**但 和ficiton对应的有non-ficiton**

所以分类图书时候对应是小说类和非小说类

而novel

**没有**

这个用法，不能用non-novel

呵呵，这个解释不错

我加上

大家怎么看？
