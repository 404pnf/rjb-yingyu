<p>It&#8217;s sorta stupid but you just couldn&#8217;t get it out of your mind in 1993. Whenever i think of this song i think i see Jiang3nan2 acting ghetto and sing &#8220;whoomp there it is&#8221;, it&#8217;s so funny!</p>

<p>For a brief time i thought tag team was a professional wrestling group. Today, by reading the wikipedia article, it confirms it&#8217;s not the case.</p>
