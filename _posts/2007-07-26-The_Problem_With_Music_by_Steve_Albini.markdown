<p><a href="http://www.negativland.com/albini.html">The Problem With Music - by Steve Albini</a></p>

<p>I will translate this article. Anybody help?</p>

<p>He is a musician and producer, you might know him as the producer for Nirvana&#8217;s album In Utero. But, he is more than that.</p>

<p>I love his way of doing recording engineers and never take the royalty assicated with CD sells since he beleives it&#8217;s immoral.</p>

<p>Read him on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini">wikipedia</a></p>
