<p>Heard this on “off the wall”, the recent show they talked about their experience in singapore. They say in singapore,  the train station broadcast video clips, advise passengers to look on/look out(?) unattended luggage, since that may be a bomb! What&#8217;s more, they shows terrorist blows up the train, people&#8217;s  body parts blowing. They show footage of london/madrid bombing, where you can see people&#8217;s body parts! This is&#8230;. I don&#8217;t know how to say it.</p>
