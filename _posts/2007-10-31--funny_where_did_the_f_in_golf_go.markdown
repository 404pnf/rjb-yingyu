  <p>You can always buy a GOL if you get confused. F knows where the F went!!</p>

  <p>The Gol was for the three developing markets, India, Brazil, and China.</p>
  
  <p>I guess to cut down on costs they knocked the back doors off and made the car shorter. The F must have been knocked off to save on cost.</p>

  I love the affordable gol~ but it&#8217;s not allowed to be sold in beijing because the its emission doesn&#8217;t qualified. Not clean enough.</p>
