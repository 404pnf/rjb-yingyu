<p>Does this mean when user register their accounts, they agree to the agreement that they never read to put their comments under CC?If this is valid. That&#8217;s good, maybe i shoud begin translate some comments. If this is valid, it&#8217;s bad, too. Because other websites may claim sole ownership of user submitted comments because they agreed to the agreement of registration.</p>
