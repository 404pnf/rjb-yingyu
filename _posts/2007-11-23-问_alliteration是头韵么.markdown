  <p>use of the same consonant at the beginning of each stressed syllable in a line of verse; &#8220;around the rock the ragged rascal ran&#8221;

  <p>Alliteration is a stylistic device, or literary technique, in which successive words (more strictly, stressed syllables) begin with the same consonant sound or letter. Alliteration is a frequent tool in poetry but it is also common in prose, particularly to highlight short phrases. Especially in poetry, it contributes to euphony of the passage, lending it a musical air. It may act to humorous effect. &#8230;
