  <p>&#8220;Cold turkey&#8221; is a term describing the actions of a person who gives up his habit or addiction at a single moment, rather than through gradually easing the process through tapering off or supplemental medication. The term allegedly derives from the comparison of a cold turkey carcass and the state of a withdrawing addict. It is often preceded by the word &#8216;going&#8217;, as &#8216;going cold turkey&#8217;.
