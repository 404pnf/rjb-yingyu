<blockquote>
  <p>More than three years later, coming back to China from almost any other country remains a slightly hallucinatory experience. &#8230;</p>
  
  <p>Thus, I was especially detached from reality when, three hours after arriving, I stumbled out to buy groceries to take me through the weekend. On the way back from the market I came across two women whose bicycles had collided at the intersection of Nanchang Road and Shaanxi Road. They were settling the matter of responsibility in true Shanghainese fashion: With a full-on, screaming, closed-fist melee while fifty onlookers crowded in for a better look.</p>
  
  <p>Well, I thought to myself, welcome home.</p>

<p>基本就是人数比较少的贴身战斗吧。啊？：）谁说过更贴切点的。</p>

<p>看这个解释</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A group combat or ‘free for all’ where teams or groups of individuals met in the field. A mêlée can describe any group combat. &#8230;

<p>这个词我当然不陌生。玩星际争霸的都应该不陌生吧。星际争霸的中文班中这个怎们翻译呀？</p>

<p>其实星际中melee和free for all还是有区别的。：）有闲心的朋友可以在留言里说说什么区别。</p>
