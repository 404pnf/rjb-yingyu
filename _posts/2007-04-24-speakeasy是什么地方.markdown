  By 1932, with a feeling that Prohibition was ending, Al Hirschfeld decided to use his artistic skill to document the various speakeasies around Manhattan. This is a first edition of Manhattan Oases, featuring thirty-six drawings of bartenders by Hirschfeld and a witty guide to &#8220;bars and beverages&#8221; by Gordan Kahn.

<p>想想也对。这里的easy应该是小声点的意思。因为当时美国在禁酒，所以你去这些非法酒馆自然邀轻声说话啦。</p>
