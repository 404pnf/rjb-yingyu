  <p>I guess what I&#8217;m saying is, there are many, many ways to foil the MAFIAA. You just have to implement them beforehand, and calmly cover every angle. Trying to do something <em>after</em> getting subpoenaed is a bad idea, because then you&#8217;re hurrying. And as you say, one tiny mistake is all it takes, and people tend to make mistakes when they hurry.</p>
