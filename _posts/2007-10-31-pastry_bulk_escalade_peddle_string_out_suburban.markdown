title: pastry bulk escalade peddle string out suburban

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m trying to ride my new bike to as many places as possible. Most days this involves riding past Booda Beans. It’s everything you would expect from a neighborhood coffee-shop-that-isn’t-Starbucks, offering coffee in various combinations of size, temperature, and artificial flavor. Plus pastries and bulk candy. On the dark side, the owner drives an Escalade and watches Fox News all day, while peddling caffeine and sugar to strung-out suburbanites. On the bright side, they offer free wireless.</p>
