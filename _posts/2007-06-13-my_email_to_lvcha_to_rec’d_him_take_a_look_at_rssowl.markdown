title: my email to lvcha to recâ€™d him take a look at rssowl
---

<p>upon read <a href="http://www.rssowl.org/node/216">this</a>, i wrote a email to lvcha to rec&#8217;d him take a look at rssowl.</p>

<p>i don&#8217;t know why i post it here. practice english? welcome you guys to anatomize my words?! haha, welcome~</p>

<p>define:</p>

<p>anatomy
anatomize</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>rssowl is written in java, it&#8217;s an
rss reader</p>

<p>i used it a few years back, had some
email exchange with the author</p>

<p>then i use thunderbird exclusively
becase i love the way it treats rss
msg as email</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>rssowl is not for me because, 1,
it&#8217;s very hard to increase text font
2 it can not archive all articles,
older ones got deleted, i talked
with the author about this he said
he would implement 3 on windows
platform it uses IE to render feed
message, though later it could use
geck-engine which is used by mozilla
andfirefox</p>

<p>i don&#8217;t want to or need to check it
out but you might be intersted</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<p>a great feature of it is it can
export multiple articles as pdf
and/or html, really handy when you
want to read something on your pda,
i used to do that a lot  <img src='http://www.rijiben.org/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<p>i noticed a lot of effort has been put into the search functionality, so, it might be strong in that area.</p>
