title: reggae is all about mashup

<blockquote>DJ Spooky: Reggae is all about the mashup! The Caribbean is a place where so many cultures were in collision: Spanish, Portuguese, Indian, British, Chinese. People tend to forget that one of Bob Marley&#8217;s producers (Leslie Kong) was Chinese-Jamaican, or that Lee Gopthal who was one of the co-owners of Trojan Records was Indian. Even the term &#8220;Ganjah&#8221; is pronounced Hindi style; it&#8217;s the Ganges river! And don&#8217;t even get me started about dreadlocks. Any holy man on the Ganges could tell you that they&#8217;re Indian too. ?</blockquote>
