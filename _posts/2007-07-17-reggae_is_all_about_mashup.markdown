>DJ Spooky: Reggae is all about the mashup! The Caribbean is a place where so many cultures were in collision: Spanish, Portuguese, Indian, British, Chinese. People tend to forget that one of Bob Marley’s producers (Leslie Kong) was Chinese-Jamaican, or that Lee Gopthal who was one of the co-owners of Trojan Records was Indian. Even the term “Ganjah” is pronounced Hindi style; it’s the Ganges river! And don’t even get me started about dreadlocks. Any holy man on the Ganges could tell you that they’re Indian too. ?

He also says Jamaca is the “loudest island” in the world. Love this description.
