<p>Transformers movie censorship</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I saw the Tranformers movie on opening night in Beijing. [snip] I&#8217;m not a fan of dubbed movies, so it of course I saw the original English version. As I listened to some of the dialog, in particular the scenes with Jon Voight (the Secretary of Defense) and some of the NSA and Pentagon scientists, I noticed some garbled words.</p>
  
  <p>They&#8217;d be having a conversation, and it would go something like this: &#8220;What we need to do, Mister Secretary, is to make sure the garble garble garble don&#8217;t garble garble garble. Then we can proceed with the original plan.&#8221;</p>
  
  <p>Censored dialog 1: about 27 minutes into the movie</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Scene: Inside the Pentagon</p>
    
    <p>Scientist 1: Guys, I think the other team figured it out: Iran.
       Scientist 2: Come on man, this is way too smart for Iranian scientists. Eh? Think about it.
       Scientist 3: What do you think Kay? Garble?
       Sc: No way, this is nothing like what the garble are using.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Garble garble&#8221; are the words have been censored.</p>
