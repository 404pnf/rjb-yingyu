Transformers movie censorship

>I saw the Tranformers movie on opening night in Beijing. [snip] I’m not a fan of dubbed movies, so it of course I saw the original English version. As I listened to some of the dialog, in particular the scenes with Jon Voight (the Secretary of Defense) and some of the NSA and Pentagon scientists, I noticed some garbled words.

  

  

They’d be having a conversation, and it would go something like this: “What we need to do, Mister Secretary, is to make sure the garble garble garble don’t garble garble garble. Then we can proceed with the original plan.”

  

  

Censored dialog 1: about 27 minutes into the movie

  

  

>Scene: Inside the Pentagon

    

    

Scientist 1: Guys, I think the other team figured it out: Iran.

       Scientist 2: Come on man, this is way too smart for Iranian scientists. Eh? Think about it.

       Scientist 3: What do you think Kay? Garble?

       Sc: No way, this is nothing like what the garble are using.

The “Garble garble” are the words have been censored.

Ha, garble garble, makes me think of that south park episode.
