     BEIJING, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Traffic accidents killed 1,171 people during Chinaâ€™s week-long National Day holiday that ended on Sunday, a drop of 43 percent from last year, Xinhua news agency reported.

    90,000 road deaths per year in China, thats pretty much a mid sized European towns population disappearing every year!

Do i really want to buy a car and get on the road?
