<p>trail brief</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A trial brief is where a party tells the court what claims it will be present at trial. It gives the judge an overview of the case. You could think of it as a kind of written, pre-trial opening statement, but to the judge. You&#8217;ve maybe seen opening statements to a jury on TV, where the lawyer tells the jury what happened and what it intends to prove, and this is similar but because it&#8217;s for the judge, it&#8217;s less dramatic. No pounding on the table.

<p>now i know why this term jumped into my head, Chris Rock starred in a movie called Down to Earth. It&#8217;s good comedy. 有一段他在多呐店里听见外面dmx的歌曲跟着唱起来特别有意思。哈哈，我印象非常深刻。之后又特别找了更多的dmx来听。从此非常喜欢dmx。</p>
