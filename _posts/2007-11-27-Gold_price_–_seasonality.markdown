title: Gold price – seasonality

<blockquote>
  <p>Gold price – seasonality
  Over the last five years, the gold price exhibited some seasonality with a strong trend to higher gold prices in December
  through to March. We believe the strong seasonal upward trend in prices is linked partly with similar seasonal trends in
  the oil price and also partly linked to increased demand for gold during the festive and marriage season in India together
  with the traditional seasonal demand from the Middle East.
  According to US Energy Department data, global oil demand peaks in Q4 when refiners in the US, Europe and North
  Asia make heating fuel for the Northern Hemisphere winter.</p>
