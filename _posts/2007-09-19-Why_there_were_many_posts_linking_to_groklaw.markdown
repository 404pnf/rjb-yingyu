<p>Why there were many posts linking to groklaw?</p>

<p>Simple answer:  i am reading it to catch up.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t access <a href="http://www.groklaw.com">http://www.groklaw.com</a> for the past 3 years. It might be accessible from time to time but i didn&#8217;t check frequently. Recently I checked again and I can access it. So I subscribe to the site via rss. It&#8217;s beyond my understanding why this particular website, specially to comment on sco vs ibm law suit, which is a mainly about so called &#8220;intellectual property&#8221; rights, is inaccessile for such a long time in China.</p>
