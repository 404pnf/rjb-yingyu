Why there were many posts linking to groklaw?

Simple answer:  i am reading it to catch up.

I couldn’t access 

[http://www.groklaw.com](http://www.groklaw.com) for the past 3 years. It might be accessible from time to time but i didn’t check frequently. Recently I checked again and I can access it. So I subscribe to the site via rss. It’s beyond my understanding why this particular website, specially to comment on sco vs ibm law suit, which is a mainly about so called “intellectual property” rights, is inaccessile for such a long time in China.
