<p>noose</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By now, you&#8217;ve probably heard the background of the case: Last September, a black student at Jena High School asked permission during an assembly if he could sit beneath the &#8220;white tree,&#8221; a tree on campus where white students traditionally gathered. The student was told that he could sit wherever he liked. The next day, three nooses hung from the so-called &#8220;white tree.&#8221; The high school’s principal recommended expulsion for the three white students responsible for hanging the nooses, but the school district’s superintendent reduced their punishment to a three-day suspension, dismissing it as an adolescent prank that didn&#8217;t threaten anyone. The black student body of Jena High School protested the white students&#8217; light punishment by gathering under the same &#8220;white tree.&#8221; LaSalle Parish District Attorney Reed Walters appeared at the school during the protest and said to students, &#8220;I can be your best friend or your worst enemy. I can take away your lives with a stroke of my pen.&#8221;

<p>数上挂个noose是什么。我猜测是那个，但不敢肯定。</p>

<p>define: noose</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>snare: a trap for birds or small mammals; often has a slip noose
  make a noose in or of
  a loop formed in a cord or rope by means of a slipknot; it binds tighter as the cord or rope is pulled
  secure with a noose

  <p>The noose is a simple knot, normally made from a small-diameter rope, that is often used by campers and hunters to catch small game. The noose has also traditionally been known as a suicide method; however the actual knot associated with this is the Hangman&#8217;s knot.

<p>看了这些解释我反而觉得像是抓小东的捕猎夹了。</p>

<p>从这张图看更应该是上吊和捕捉小动物的用的圈套/绳子？怎么说更准确啊。</p>

<p>此事发生在<strong><em>2007</em></strong>年的美国！！</p>
