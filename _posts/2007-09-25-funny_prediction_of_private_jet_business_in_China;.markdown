  <p>It&#8217;s only a matter of time. And I predict:</p>
  
  <p>1) All the planes will be black</p>
  
  <p>2) They&#8217;ll all have those &#8220;whonk whonk!&#8221; official sounding horns</p>
  
  <p>3) There will be a lively black market in military and official hull registration numbers.</p>
  
  <p>4) If you think it sucks to have private planes preempting commercial traffic in the US, wait until the same dynamic starts to infest China&#8217;s overmatched civil aviation infrastructure. Having watched the second ring get closed for a motorcade in Beijing yesterday yet again&#8230;</p>
