<blockquote>
  <p>At first you don&#8217;t really understand what the bok is about. Things are not put down as you&#8217;d expect from reading any of the authors previous works. Completely umlike &#8220;1234&#8243; and the award acclaimmed &#8220;Abcd&#8221;, &#8220;Asdfas&#8221; takes a very surprising route. The narrative is very caotic, intricate, and really makes the reader play a game with the pages. It reminded me a little bit of Julio Cort√°zar&#8217;s work in &#8220;Hopscotch&#8221;. Great effort by indian postwar master Asdf.</p>
