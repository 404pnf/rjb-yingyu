*The Stirling engine, also known as the hot air engine, is a heat engine of the external combustion piston engine type. Its invention is credited to the Scottish clergyman Rev. Robert Stirling in 1816 who made significant improvements to earlier designs and took out the first patent. He was later assisted in its development by his engineer brother James Stirling.
