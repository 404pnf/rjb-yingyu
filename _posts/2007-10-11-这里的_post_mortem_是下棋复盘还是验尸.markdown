<p>这里的 post-mortem 是下棋复盘还是验尸？！</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It has been a little over two weeks since our facility move. I believe at some point we promised some post-mortem analysis of what went right and what went wrong, and here it is.</p>

<p>define: post-mortem</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Analysis of a game after it has concluded, typically conducted by one or both players and sometimes spectators (kibitzers) as well.

  <p>analysis following a game

<p>这两个解释我理解就是下棋复盘的意思。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>postmortem: discussion of an event after it has occurred
  autopsy: an examination and dissection of a dead body to determine cause of death or the changes produced by disease

<p>这里第一个解释不好理解为复盘，第2个autopsy是尸体解剖吧。dissection是把什么东西分开，具体这里把什么分开了，你自己看。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An autopsy, also known as a post-mortem examination, necropsy, or obduction, is a medical procedure that consists of a thorough examination of a human corpse to determine the cause and manner of a person&#8217;s death and to evaluate any disease or injury that may be present. &#8230;
  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Mortem</p>
</blockquote>

<p>这个解释让我认为这个词是验尸的意思。因为解剖目的是查明死因。</p>

<p>不知道我的理解对不对。</p>

<p>那么我给的那段引文如何翻译呢。翻译成复盘么？有没有更好的答案。参与一下吧。</p>
