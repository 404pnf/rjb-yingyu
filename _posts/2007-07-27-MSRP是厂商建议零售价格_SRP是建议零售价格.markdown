<p>What is MSRP?</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suggested_retail_price">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suggested_retail_p...</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The (manufacturer&#8217;s) suggested retail price (MSRP or SRP), list price or recommended retail price (RRP) (originally, Monroney suggested retail price) of a product is the price the manufacturer recommends that the retailer sell it for. The intention was to help to standardize prices among locations. While some stores always sell at, or below, the suggested retail price, others do so only when items are on sale or closeout.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>就是所谓“厂商建议零售价格”，中文里也听到过厂商指导价格这个说法，不知道是不是说这个。英文中可以说MSRP或SRP。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suggested pricing methods may conflict with competition theory, as it allows prices to be set higher than would otherwise be the case, potentially negatively impacting consumers. However, resale price maintenance goes further than this and is illegal in many regions.</p>
  
  <p>Much of the time, stores charge less than the suggested retail price, depending upon the actual wholesale cost of each item, usually purchased in bulk from the manufacturer, or in smaller quantities through a distributor.</p>
  
  <p>Suggested prices can also be manipulated to be unreasonably high, allowing retailers to use deceptive advertising by showing the excessive price and then their actual selling price, implying to customers that they are somehow getting a &#8220;discount&#8221; or a &#8220;great deal&#8221;[citation needed].</p>

<p>这三段都是说这种建议加个也许和市场竞争想违背；在商店中实际购买的成交加个一般会本srp便宜；有些msrp是人为订得非常高，在随后的广告中显示这个高价，暗示消费着成交价比安个srp低，所以展了便宜。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Game shows have long made use of suggested retail prices both as a game element, in which the contestant must determine the retail price of an item, or in valuating their prizes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>这个最好玩。有些娱乐节目会给参赛人一些厂商指导价，让大家猜它的实际价格来竞赛。</p>

<p>电视购物中有时会出厂商建议零售价格，有时还说什么“市场价”（虽然在市场上你基本买不到它卖）然后以“很低的价格卖给你”。“对！你没听错！就是这么低的价格！”而且“半小时内拨打电话还有更多礼品呢”。</p>

<p>真是让人心动啊～ 是不是？：）</p>

<p>MSRP~&#8230;. shite~</p>
