<p>bq. (meaning literally `born&#8217;) used to indicate the maiden or family name of a married woman; &#8220;Hillary Clinton nee Rodham&#8221;

<p>bq. The French word née (feminine) or né (masculine) (or the English word nee) is still commonly used in some newspapers when mentioning the maiden name of a woman in engagement or wedding announcements. The word nee is also used to denote former names, (as opposed to birth names), and earlier names of inanimate entities such as companies and products. Né is the past participle of naître (to be born) and means born in the French language.
