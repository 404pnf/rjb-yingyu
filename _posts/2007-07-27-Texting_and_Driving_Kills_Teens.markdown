<p>Texting and Driving Kills Teens</p>

<p>Sad sad story.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In late June, a 17-year-old driving an SUV in East Bloomfield, New York slammed head-on into a truck, killing her and four other recent high school grads in the car. Police claim text messaging (to friends in a following car) moments before the crash was a contributory factor. &#8220;The records indicate her phone was in use,&#8221; Sheriff Phil Povero said diplomatically. &#8220;We will never be able to clearly state that she was the one doing the text messaging.&#8221; Meanwhile, according to new research by SADD (Students Against Destructive Decisions) and Liberty Mutual Insurance Group, instant and text messaging top the list as the biggest driving distraction for teens. Seventy-three percent of teens admit to talking on a cell phone while behind the wheel. Where do teens pick up these bad habits? Some 62 percent of high school-aged teens told researchers their parents talk on a cell while driving.

<p>Which part is &#8220;said diplomatically&#8221;?</p>

<p>I am assuming by saying &#8220;we will never be able to clearly state that she was the one doing the text messaging.&#8221; would help to relinquish her family some pressure and even law suits from parents of those 4 kids in the car.</p>
