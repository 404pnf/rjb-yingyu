title: IP intellectual property seductive mirage

<blockquote>
  <p>When you see a big company threatening patent suits, sell. When a company starts fighting over IP, it&#8217;s a sign they&#8217;ve lost the real battle, for users.

<p>IP has more than one meaning. Here, it referes to the Seductive Mirage: Intellectual Property.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Did You Say &#8220;Intellectual Property&#8221;? It&#8217;s a Seductive Mirage
  by Richard M. Stallman</p>
  
  <p>It has become fashionable to describe copyright, patents, and trademarks as &#8220;intellectual property&#8221;. This fashion did not arise by accident&#8211;the term systematically distorts and confuses these issues, and its use was and is promoted by those who gain from this confusion. Anyone wishing to think clearly about any of these laws would do well to reject the term.</p>
  
  <p>One effect of the term is a bias that is not hard to see: it suggests thinking about copyright, patents and trademarks by analogy with property rights for physical objects. (This analogy is at odds with the legal philosophies of copyright law, of patent law, and of trademark law, but only specialists know that.) These laws are in fact not much like physical property law, but use of this term leads legislators to change them to be more so. Since that is the change desired by the companies that exercise copyright, patent and trademark powers, these companies have worked to make the term fashionable.</p>
  
  <p>According to Professor Mark Lemley, now of the Stanford Law School, the widespread use of the term &#8220;intellectual property&#8221; is a fad that followed the 1967 founding of the World &#8220;Intellectual Property&#8221; Organization, and only became really common in the past few years. (WIPO is formally a UN organization, but in fact it represents the interests of the holders of copyrights, patents and trademarks.)</p>
  
  <p>Those who would prefer to judge these issues on their merits should reject a biased term for them. Many have asked me to propose some other name for the category&#8211;or proposed alternatives themselves. Suggestions include IMPs, for Imposed Monopoly Privileges, and GOLEMs, for Government-Originated Legally Enforced Monopolies. Some speak of &#8220;exclusive rights regimes&#8221;, but this means referring to restrictions as rights, which is doublethink too.</p>
  
  <p>But it is a mistake to replace &#8220;intellectual property&#8221; with any other term. A different name could eliminate the bias, but won&#8217;t address the term&#8217;s deeper problem: overgeneralization. There is no such unified thing as &#8220;intellectual property&#8221;. It is a mirage, which appears to have a coherent existence only because the term suggests it does.</p>
  
  <p>The term &#8220;intellectual property&#8221; operates as a catch-all to lump together disparate laws. Non-lawyers who hear the term &#8220;intellectual property&#8221; applied to these various laws tend to assume they are instances of a common principle, and that they function similarly. Nothing could be further from the case.</p>
  
  <p>These laws originated separately, evolved differently, cover different activities, have different rules, and raise different public policy issues. Copyright law was designed to promote authorship and art, and covers the details of a work of authorship or art. Patent law was intended to encourage publication of ideas, at the price of finite monopolies over these ideas&#8211;a price that may be worth paying in some fields and not in others. Trademark law was not intended to promote any business activity, but simply to enable buyers to know what they are buying; however, legislators under the influence of &#8220;intellectual property&#8221; have turned it into a scheme that provides incentives for advertising (without asking the public if we want more advertising).</p>
  
  <p>Since these laws developed independently, they are different in every detail as well as in their basic purposes and methods. Thus, if you learn some fact about copyright law, you had best assume that patent law is different. You&#8217;ll rarely go wrong that way!</p>
  
  <p>Laymen are not alone in getting confused by this term. I regularly find that experts on patent law, copyright law, and trademark law, even law professors who teach these subjects, have been lured by the seductiveness of the term &#8220;intellectual property&#8221; into general statements that conflict with the facts they know. The term distracts them from using their own knowledge.</p>
