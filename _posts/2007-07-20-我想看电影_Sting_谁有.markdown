Who has the film - The Sting -? Please tell me if the soundtrack of the movie is regtime music. I just listened to this composer who did the soundtrack, he also did the &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Way_We_Were:The_title_song">the way we were</a>&#8220;, hmm, the &#8220;Memory~, di duh duh di duh di duh&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oh, there you go, the composer is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Hamlisch">Marvin Hamlisch</a>, his lecture on penn state university is great. You can download it from WPSU podcast, just search it, and post the link in the comment, thanks. <img src='http://www.rijiben.org/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  &#8230;.. update: could this be the link to that mp3 file? <a href="http://streams.wpsx.psu.edu/Marvin_Hamlisch06012.html">http://streams.wpsx.psu.edu/Marvin_Hamlisch0601...</a> How do you download the mp3.
