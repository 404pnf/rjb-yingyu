<p>bad hair day
<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bad+hair+day">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=...</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A bad hair day is also a day when everything is going bad. It has nothing to do with how one&#8217;s hair really is, it&#8217;s just that everything is going wrong. The term &#8220;bad hair day&#8221; derives from how psycho one feels because everything is going all wrong on a particular day!!</p>

<p>第一次听到这个词似乎是在Office Space这部经典电影中。：）可能吧。</p>
