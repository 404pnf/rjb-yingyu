<p>blooper 直电影结束时出演职人员字母的时候播放的电影拍摄中出错的片段。中文是什么？</p>

<p>blooper 直电影结束时出演职人员字母的时候播放的电影拍摄中出错的片段。中文是什么？有时候也叫outtake</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A blooper usually describes a short sequence of a film or video production which contains a mistake made by a member of the cast or crew. These bloopers, or outtakes as they are also called, are often the subject of television shows or are sometimes revealed during the credit sequence at the end of the movies. (Jackie Chan and Burt Reynolds are both famous for including such reels with the closing credits of their movies.) Humorous mistakes made by athletes are often referred to as bloopers as well, particularly in baseball. In East Asia, bloopers are referred as NG&#8217;s (No Good)[citation needed].</p>

<p>哈哈，原来NG是No Good的意思啊。：O 哈哈。</p>
