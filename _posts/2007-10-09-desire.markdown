<p>desire</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For Freud, desire is always defined in the negative term of lack - you always desire what you don&#8217;t have or what you are not, and it is very unlikely that you will fulfill this desire. Thus his psychoanalysis treatment is meant to teach the patient to cope with his unsatisfiable desires.</p>
