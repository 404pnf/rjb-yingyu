<blockquote>
  <p>I got an email from Fred von Lohmann of the Electronic Frontier Foundation yesterday. It began, &#8220;Half the companies you blog about have copyright or privacy legal issues simmering just under the surface. Since most of them are thinly capitalized, when they get into trouble, they&#8217;re likely to call EFF for legal advice. Several already have.&#8221;</p>

<p>这里的simmering我翻译不出来。我理解是指要出现还没出现的那种潜在的危险。</p>

<p>谁来说说？</p>

<p>simmer</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>temperature just below the boiling point; &#8220;the stew remained at a simmer for hours&#8221;
  boil slowly at low temperature; &#8220;simmer the sauce&#8221;; &#8220;simmering water&#8221;

  <p>Simmering is a cooking technique in which foods are cooked in hot liquids kept at or just barely below the boiling point of water (at average sea level air pressure), 100 °C (212 °F). &#8230;
