  Consultants, as a general rule, like to use products that are too

  hard for their clients to use, because it guarantees them ongoing

  employment.  Consultants would come to our Web site, which said

  all over it that our software was so easy to use that it would let

  anyone make an online store in five minutes, and they’d say, there’s

  no way we’re using that.  So we didn’t get a lot of interest from

  Web consultants.  Instead the users all tended to be end-users,

  the actual merchants themselves.  They loved the idea of being in

  control of their own Web sites.  And this kind of user did not want

  to do any kind of programming.  They just used the default templates.

I repeat: “In fact it turned out that Web consultants didn’t like Viaweb.

Consultants, as a general rule, like to use products that are too

hard for their clients to use, because it guarantees them ongoing

employment. “
