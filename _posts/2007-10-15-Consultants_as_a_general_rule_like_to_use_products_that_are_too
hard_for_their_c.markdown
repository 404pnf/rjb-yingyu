  <p>In fact it turned out that Web consultants didn&#8217;t like Viaweb.
  Consultants, as a general rule, like to use products that are too
  hard for their clients to use, because it guarantees them ongoing
  employment.  Consultants would come to our Web site, which said
  all over it that our software was so easy to use that it would let
  anyone make an online store in five minutes, and they&#8217;d say, there&#8217;s
  no way we&#8217;re using that.  So we didn&#8217;t get a lot of interest from
  Web consultants.  Instead the users all tended to be end-users,
  the actual merchants themselves.  They loved the idea of being in
  control of their own Web sites.  And this kind of user did not want
  to do any kind of programming.  They just used the default templates.

<p>I repeat: &#8220;In fact it turned out that Web consultants didn&#8217;t like Viaweb.

hard for their clients to use, because it guarantees them ongoing
employment. &#8220;</p>
