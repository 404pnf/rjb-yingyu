---

moonshine is a crime could be sentenced up to more than 30 years in jail! Why?!

>Because the liquor is worth more to the government than beer or wine. Uncle Sam takes an excise tax of $2.14 for each 750-milliliter bottle of 80-proof spirits, compared with 21 cents for a bottle of wine (of 14 percent alcohol or less) and 5 cents for a can of beer.

这里的moonshine可不是月光。是私自造酒，特制酒精含量高的liquor，一般就是咱们说的白酒？

看到了么，liquor的税要比葡萄酒和啤酒高得多的多！

spirits这里是也是酒的意思。

>*(1) liquor, spirits, booze, hard drink, hard liquor, John Barleycorn, strong drink — (an alcoholic beverage that is distilled rather than fermented)

这个肯定是酒。中文看来得搬出一些酒的俗语来对应了。：）谁来试试？

proof这里指酒的度数？

>*proof — (a measure of alcoholic strength expressed as an integer twice the percentage of alcohol present (by volume))

是究竟含量的两倍，就是酒含40%容量的酒精的话就是80度？

>Government prosecutors point out that moonshine poses serious health risks, including heavy-metal toxicity. So, how dangerous is it? There’s no inspection of the manufacturing process, so quality—and levels of contamination—vary. (There are some informal and imprecise ways to test the purity of hooch: You can light some on fire and check for a blue flame or shake the pint and look for clear liquid drops that dissipate quickly.) Aside from drinking too much and doing something dumb—oh, like attacking somebody with a chain saw and fire extinguisher— the biggest risk is lead poisoning, since a homemade still might consist of car radiators or pipes that were dangerously soldered together. One study in the Annals of Emergency Medicine in September 2003 found that more than half of moonshine drinkers have enough lead in their bloodstream to exceed what the CDC calls a “level of concern.”
