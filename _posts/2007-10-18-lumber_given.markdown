<p>lumber这个意思法我是刚知道。以前只知道第4个意思。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The issue now before the judge is what relief to grant the copyright-owner plaintiffs against StreamCast, which is the only defendant still standing. It’s apparently a given that the judge will eventually assess monetary damages against StreamCast. And you’d think these damages would be enough to kill StreamCast, so it’s not clear why StreamCast hasn’t just thrown in the towel, shut its doors, and handed over all its assets to the plaintiffs. Instead, StreamCast fought on, so the judge had to decide what kind of injunction, if any, to impose on StreamCast — that is, what rules would govern StreamCast’s future behavior.

<p>given</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>acknowledged as a supposition; &#8220;given the engine&#8217;s condition, it is a wonder that it started&#8221;

<p>这里用第3个解释很合适</p>
