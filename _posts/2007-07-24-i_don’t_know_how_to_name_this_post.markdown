  <p>In the segment I can see, he is the only person who&#8217;s body is completely unobstructed. He has the greatest amount of negative space around him. His hand is upraised in beneficence. He&#8217;s surrounded by positive symbols; doves of peace, a pearl of harmony (according to the artist &#8212; don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s accepted symbolism), and peaches of longevity (which are accepted symbolism). He&#8217;s conspicuously taller than Donald Tsang (which may be literally true). Intentionally or not, it&#8217;s a case study in cult-of-personality iconography. The only difference is that instead of being surrounded by an idealized version of the common people he&#8217;s surrounded by an ordered version of Hong Kong&#8217;s power elite.</p>
