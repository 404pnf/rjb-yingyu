>Me: We don’t have a contract with the hotel, we can’t just write them cheques willy-nilly! And we most certainly cannot act as a guarantee for all our clients.

  

  

Harpy: They won’t bank it in, they just want a guarantee. It doesn’t need to say anything, you can just (I swear to God this is exactly what she said) write a blank cheque.

  

  

Me: 

sputtering I… WHAT?

  

  

Harpy: That’s right, you heard me.

  

  

Me: Look Miss Harpy, I don’t think you understand the definition of a guarantor. In fact, there is no agreement, written or otherwise, that names our company asParty A’s guarantor.

  

  

Harpy: 

spitting fire I don’t see what the big deal is.
