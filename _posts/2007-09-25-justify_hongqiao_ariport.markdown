title: justify hongqiao ariport

<blockquote>
  <p>This choke point serves the entire airport, with exactly the result you would expect. Everyone waits. I once waited for an hour and then got a taxi driver who complained bitterly that he had waited for two hours and I was too small a fare to justify his wait.

<p>justify</p>

<ul>
<li>show to be reasonable or provide adequate ground for; &#8220;The emergency does not warrant all of us buying guns&#8221;; &#8220;The end justifies the means&#8221;</li>

<p>翻译justify？不足以弥补他等待的时间？不好，因为没有弥补，make up的意思。直接用“不值得”很好。但组织不起来整个句子。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That&#8217;s why the pirate taxis at Hongqiao always use the same pitch: &#8220;Hey, mister! Taxi-no-waiting!&#8221; Spectacular, as long as you don&#8217;t mind paying quadruple over a metered trip and re-bargaining at the halfway point. The bottleneck for legit taxis is so well designed to keep the pirate taxis in business that you&#8217;d think the airport administration was taking a tax-free cut off the top.</p>
