title: Remember when banks used to pay you for borrowing your money It’s true They
  did Ask your parents

>So Citibank, if you are reading this, please reckognize that the money you keep from my reach when you deny my card is in fact 

MY money and not yours. Citibank told me on the phone today that this is for 

MY protection when it is in fact for Citibanks protection because they are legally responsible to cover fraudulent charges to my account. So, Citibank basically denys whatever they feel like apparently- or whatever the computer algorithm decides to deny.

  

  

Sorry to ramble. Bottom line: Citibank’s name is mud to me and if this trouble continues, I will take the issue more publicly through my audio and video programs and, of course, find another bank who will allow me access to my own money.

  

  

Remember when banks used to pay you for borrowing your money? It’s true. They did. Ask your parents

it’s called a debit card.

i don’t have credit card, and i don’t want one either. There had been a craze in solicitating/forcing people to have a credit card in the past one year!!!
