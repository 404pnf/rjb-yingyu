<p>yes! yes! now i know  how to express my opinion on &#8220;popular&#8221;.</p>

<p>bq. Dr. Jared Ball in his composition, &#8220;Hip-Hop, Mass Media &amp; 21st Century Colonization,&#8221; states: &#8220;Given the societal need and function of mass media and popular culture, all that is popular is fraudulent. Popularity is in almost every case an intentionally constructed fabrication of what it claims to represent. Too few who comment on the lamentable condition of today&#8217;s popular hip-hop seem to grasp this, the political nature of the nation&#8217;s media system, nor the political function that system serves. Hip-hop is often taken out of the existing context of political struggle, repression, or the primacy of a domestic/neo-colonialism in the service of which mass media play a (the?) leading role.</p>
