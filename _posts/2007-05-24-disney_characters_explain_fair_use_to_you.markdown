title: disney characters explain fair use to you

<p>Love the idea! Great work!</p>

<p>Hollywood, in particular, Disney is against fair use in any possible way. By using Disney characters (I assume it&#8217;s unauthorized use, cos Disney won&#8217;t allow that happen) to explain fair use, in which the movie itself is an example of fair use (I assume it is fair use). I 
like the idea.</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/CJn_jC4FNDo"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/CJn_jC4FNDo" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p>Fair use is never a clear cut. I am fine with that. I am fine with going to a judge and let him decide whether it&#8217;s fair use or not. I am against any kind of anti-circumvention law which practically abolish fair use.</p>
