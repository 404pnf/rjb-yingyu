<p>cityscape</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>this one purporting to show that Beijing is the most beautiful city in China. I can&#8217;t deny the interest in this survey: there are many impressive things about China, but cityscapes generally are not one of them, and I am always on the look-out for places I can take visitors to impress them without having to drive hours and hours into the countryside to show them a dramatic vista of mountains and clear skies.

<li><p>A skyline is best described as the overall or partial view or relief of a city&#8217;s tall buildings and structures. It can also be described as the artificial horizon that a city&#8217;s overall structure creates. Skylines are a good representation of a city’s overall power; the more prominent the skyline, the more money the city has to spend. Skylines also serve as a kind of fingerprint of a city, as no two skylines are alike. &#8230;
