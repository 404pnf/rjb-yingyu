  <p>When it rains, it pours, they say. First, SCO files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and now on the same day Judge Dale Kimball has denied SCO&#8217;s Motion for Reconsideration or Clarification of the August 10, 2007 Order. Here&#8217;s his Order [PDF]. I wrote an article earlier today about SCO&#8217;s Reply Memorandum in support of this motion, and as you&#8217;ll see, I am not surprised at the denial.
